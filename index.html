            <div class="aboutmealign">
                <p>I'm a recent High School graduate determined to learn more about computer software
                    and how it functions.
                    I have an unhealthy obsession for pasta and crawfish, especially if they're combined. I have a
                    cat
                    named
                    Caesar (as seen to the right) and he also has an unhealthy obsession for food. I wish to make
                    video
                    games someday and I am a huge fan of old, retro-like games like Pokemon (my favorite being
                    Pokemon
                    Mystery
                    Dungeon: Sky made in 2009), Mario (my favorite being Super Mario Bros 3 made in 1988), Sonic (my
                    favorite being the first Sonic Adventure in the series, which was also released in 1988), and
                    more.
                    I am
                    also heavily inspired by the GameBoy and DS (mostly the GameBoy Advance SP and the DS Lite,
                    which I
                    own
                    both momentarily) and hope to expand my knowledge of how that certain hardware works. My
                    favorite
                    color
                    is orange but I hate the flavor of orange (how shocking). I really enjoy fall or winter, which
                    has
                    both
                    of my favorite holidays; Halloween and Christmas.</p>
